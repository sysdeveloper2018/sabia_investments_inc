# 🔄 Data Sync Solutions

## Current Issue
Your app works perfectly but data doesn't sync between devices because it uses browser localStorage (device-specific storage).

## Solutions

### Option 1: Backend Sync (Best)
Deploy the backend server to sync data across all devices.

### Option 2: Cloud Storage
Use services like Firebase or Supabase for real-time sync.

### Option 3: Manual Export/Import
Add CSV export/import to manually sync data.

---

## Quick Fix: Export/Import Feature

I can add buttons to:
- Export data to CSV
- Import data from CSV
- Sync manually between devices

Would you like me to add this feature?
